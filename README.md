WebServer written in C that can deploy a static website from github and update it.

Originally a CS 241 MP, but it is now modified to be memory efficient and work with github.

Since this is an outdated MP and UIUC is not attempting to remove repos I am assuming it is acceptable to make this public. Upon request by the University I am happy to take this down. However I would also suggest you get [these](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=cs+225+github) and [these](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=cs+225+github) taken down as well.
